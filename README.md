### Project title
QT’s Roomies 

### What and why?
If you decide to dorm your freshman year of NYU, since you’re a new student you likely don’t know anyone that you would like to live with. NYU makes you fill out a brief questionnaire of your sleeping habits so that they can match you with a random roommate who has similar habits. However, this is often still a poor match and the questionnaire does not account for different personalities. We would like to create a roommate matching app where students can make profiles that display their personalities and lifestyles. They can then match with other students and chat with them to get a feel for a potential roommate, rather than leaving NYU to do the pairings. This is also helpful for people living off campus because Many people would not feel comfortable living with a stranger, but if they find someone within their college community it adds a level of security and their lifestyles would be more compatible. 
.
### For whom?
This software is for NYU students (and maybe eventually college students in general), both on campus and off campus who are looking for a roommate. 

### How?
You start by making a profile and completing it by filling in a short questionnaire / and additional (buzzfeed-esque) ‘quizzes’. We will use these answers to algorithmically curate a list of possible roommates for each student. These will be presented in a “swipe left / right” interface. Additional features such as direct messaging (after matching) will be added to ensure that one gets an appropriate roommate that they feel comfortable with. To ensure student safety, we will confirm students’ identity using their University Email account. 

### Scope
Having never made a mobile application before, this will all be a new technology for us to explore. Further, a preference based algorithm needs to be developed which might require an understanding of data science. The applications require clean, interesting and easy to use UI/UX development as we are targeting a more young audience. To ensure a good design for the UI, we might need to develop UI on bootstrap or Adobe XD.
Further, we could utilize API’s to connect our app with existing content providers (Netflix, Spotify, Audible etc.) to help find students better matches—and have integrations with Instagram and Facebook.
There are many features of this app that allow it to be easily broken down into smaller pieces so that the work can be divided among group members. This also allows us to continually make changes to our initial plan if we decide that any specific feature is out of the scope of our knowledge—making it well suited for us to learn the Scrum framework.
